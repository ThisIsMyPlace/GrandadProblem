Seven thieves try to share a hoard of gold bars equally between themselves. Unfortunately, six bars are left over, and in the fight over them, 
one thief is killed. The remaining six thieves, still unable to share the bars equally since two are left over, again fight, and another 
is killed. When the remaining five thieves share the bars, one bar is left over, and it is only after yet another thief is killed that an equal 
sharing is possible.
	What is the minimum number of bars which allows this to happen?
----------------------------

This is a maths problem which can be solved using techniques that one would normally not learn until studying for a degree. But I thing -you- 
could write a computer program which would find the solution. Try.
